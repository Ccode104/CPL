1)1024 bit Number Implementaion using C
•	Only the standard libraries in C were used. Exact 1024 bits were used to store the number in signed magnitude format.
•	Bit manipulations using left shift and right shift operators, application of multiplication algorithm used at assembly level in C using the bitwise operartors(which is faster than bit by bit multiplication), and application of the concepts studied in Computer Organisation Course.

2)Heap Management using C
•	No structure(data type) is defined for the metadata .It is strictly implemented using the char data type in accordance with byte addressable memory with heap being an array of character type.
•	Heavy usage of pointers and both converting and non-converting type casting is followed for storing and retrieving the data from heap.
•	The data can be allocated on the heap using user defined malloc_h() and can be freed using free_h() with similar usage as of malloc() and free().
•	The data on heap can be read and displayed using any standard functions like printf().
